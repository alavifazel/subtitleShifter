# subtitleShifter
A small python script that shifts all subtitle text by a given time.

Have you ever loaded an .srt file and all of the text was off by a few seconds? This small script will fix that for you.
## Usage
```
python subtitleShifter.py -f <InputFile> -t <TimeToShift>
```
For example:
```
python subtitleShifter.py -f subtitle.srt -t 2.2
```
